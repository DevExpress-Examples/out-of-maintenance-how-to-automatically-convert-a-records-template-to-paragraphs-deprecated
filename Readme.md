# How to automatically convert a record's template to paragraphs when a field is inserted into a report

> **Note**
>
> As you may already know, the [WinForms Snap control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/11373/controls-and-libraries/snap) and [Snap Report API](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/15188/snap-report-api) are now in maintenance support mode. No new features or capabilities are incorporated into these products. We recommend that you use [DevExpress Reporting](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/2162/reporting) tool to generate, edit, print, and export your business reports/documents.

<p>This example demonstrates how the default record template (Table) can be converted to paragraphs automatically when a field is dragged and dropped from the Data Explorer.</p><p>In this example, this functionality is implemented in the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressSnapCoreAPISnapDocument_PrepareSnListtopic">SnapDocument.PrepareSnList</a> event handler.</p>
